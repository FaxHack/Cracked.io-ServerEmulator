# Cracked.io-ServerEmulator

Server Emulator for https://cracked.io/auth. Made by https://github.com/CabboShiba &amp; https://github.com/FaxHack

# How it works

It starts a HTTPS Server, using NetCoreServer, after it modifies the Hosts File, in order to allow HTTPS Redirection.

It generates a valid response, with random credentials. It also uses Max Rank possible, Supreme (Worth 60 $).

# IS THAT A BYPASS?

Absolutely NO. This program IS NOT a Cracked.io Bypass, as its purpose is only to emulate the Cracke.io Auth Server, and this can be done by every program, or even manually!

So please, do not call my Emulator, a "Bypass", because you would spread false information.

It is not Cracked.io's fault. They provide a great Auth system.

THIS IS NOT THE SAME EMULATION AS Cracked.io Auth "BYPASSES". THE TERM EMULATION HERE REFERS TO "EMULATING" A PUBLIC SERVER BY USING THE SAME Cracked.io auth APPLICATION INFORMATION TO MAKE THIS TOOL LOOKS LIKE THE SERVER. IT DOES NOT INTERACT WITH THE PROGRAM'S MEMORY IN ANY WAY.

# How to use

- Run "CertificateBypass.pfx".

- Select "Local PC".

- Insert the password: "shiba".

- Add it to the Trusted Root CA Folder.

- Press enter.

- Now you can start the Emulator without a problem.

# Requirement's

This program only shows a method that can be done manually without any problem. It is basically a clone of the original cracked.io auth Server. This can be done by everyone, and it does not interact with Process Memory.

It does not modify programs in any way.
